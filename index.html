    <summary>History of Indian Poker Game </summary>
    <p>
      Online rummy is legal. It is protected under the Constitution of India under Article 19[1](g) for being a game of skill. In fact, court rulings consider games of skill (like rummy) a business activity and treat it thus.<br><br>

      The 1968 ruling of the Honourable Supreme Court of India states that Rummy is a skill-based cards game where success depends on the “mere skill” of the person, which cannot be regarded as “gambling.” However, the Indian states, including Sikkim, Telangana, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Nagaland, Assam, Kerala and Odisha, are exempted from this law. Therefore, abiding by the law, A23 Rummy does not offer its Rummy games facilities to players located in any of the mentioned states.<br><br>
      
      Play online rummy games for cash and it’s completely legal in India. being a game of skill, Rummy does not fall under gambling and there is no element of ‘luck or fortune’ involved. Playing rummy games online for real cash is 100% legal in India.<br><br>
      
      While the apex court has ruled in the favour of the game, players from the following states are not allowed to play rummy for cash:<br><br>
      
      Playing rummy online is 100% Legal. As per Supreme Court's decision, it is absolutely legal to play rummy cash games online for free in India (except for the states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Kerala, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu & Telangana).<br><br>
      
      The laws of these states are ambiguous regarding playing online rummy for cash. As a result, A23 cannot allow players living in these areas participate with money. They can, however, play the free games and can participate for money once the laws in these states become clearer or change.<br><br>

    <summary>Variants of Online Poker Game?</summary>
    <p>
      It is quite easy to learn how to play rummy online. Indian rummy can be played either on two player tables or six player tables with a single deck or with two decks of cards, respectively. Players sit around a table, picking and discarding cards when their turn comes. Cards can be picked from either a closed deck or an open deck. However, the discarded cards must be placed in the open deck.<br><br>

      When playing rummy online, your objective is to defeat all other players at the table by making sequences and sets of cards first. You can play the free games on A23 to get a hang of it.<br><br>
      
      The objective of rummy is to arrange the 13 cards you’ve been dealt into sets and sequences. Each game requires you to make at least 2 sequences – one of which must be without a Joker (pure sequence), while the other one can use the Joker. The game commences with a toss that decides which player will make the first move. Remember: focus on making a pure sequence first, then the second sequence, followed by other sequences or sets.<br><br>
      
      A game with a single deck of cards moves rapidly where you can count the cards discarded by your opponent and create a strategy accordingly. With a game involving two decks, it becomes a little difficult. <br><br>
